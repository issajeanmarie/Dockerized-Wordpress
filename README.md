## DOCKERIZED WORDPRESS

This is a basic wordpress project created using docker.
It is containerized and can be used anywhere.

### Requirements

- Docker
- Text editor

Once you have docker installed on your machine,
go into this project directory and run `docker-compose up`
and you will be able to see your project at `localhost:8080`

<br />

Make sure nothing else is running on port `8080` though
